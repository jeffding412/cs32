Homework 1 gave you extensive experience with the Map type using both arrays and dynamically-allocated arrays. In this project, you will re-write the implementation of the Map type to employ a doubly-linked list rather than an array. You must not use arrays. You will also implement a couple of algorithms that operate on maps.

Implement Map yet again
Consider the Map interface from problem 2 of Homework 1:

using KeyType = TheTypeOfTheKeysGoesHere;
using ValueType = TheTypeOfTheValuesGoesHere;

class Map
{
public:
Map();
bool empty() const;
int size() const;
bool insert(const KeyType& key, const ValueType& value);
bool update(const KeyType& key, const ValueType& value);
bool insertOrUpdate(const KeyType& key, const ValueType& value);
bool erase(const KeyType& key);
bool contains(const KeyType& key) const;
bool get(const KeyType& key, ValueType& value) const;
bool get(int i, KeyType& key, ValueType& value) const;
void swap(Map& other);
};
In problem 3 of Homework 1, you implemented this interface using an array. For this project, implement this Map interface using a doubly-linked list. (You must not use the list class template from the C++ library.)

For the array implementation of problem 3 of Homework 1, since you declared no destructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator, the compiler wrote them for you, and they did the right thing. For this linked list implementation, if you let the compiler write the destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator, they will do the wrong thing, so you will have to declare and implement these public member functions as well:

Destructor
When a Map is destroyed, the nodes in the linked list must be deallocated.
Copy constructor
When a brand new Map is created as a copy of an existing Map, enough new nodes must be allocated to hold a duplicate of the original list.
Assignment operator
When an existing Map (the left-hand side) is assigned the value of another Map (the right-hand side), the result must be that the left-hand side object is a duplicate of the right-hand side object, with no memory leak of list nodes (i.e. no list node from the old value of the left-hand side should be still allocated yet inaccessible).
Notice that there is now no a priori limit on the maximum number of key/value pairs in the Map (so insertOrUpdate should always return true). Notice also that, as in Homework 1, if a Map has a size of n, then the values of the first parameter to the three-parameter form of get for which that function retrieves a key and a value and returns true are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1; for other values, it returns false without setting its second and third parameters. This is the same visible behavior as in Homework 1.

Another requirement is that as in Problem 5 of Homework 1, the number of statement executions when swapping two maps must be the same no matter how many key/value pairs are in the maps.

Implement some map algorithms
Implement the following two functions. Notice that they are non-member functions: They are not members of Map or any other class, so they must not access private members of Map.

bool combine(const Map& m1, const Map& m2, Map& result);
When this function returns, result must consist of pairs determined by these rules:

If a key appears in exactly one of m1 and m2, then result must contain a pair consisting of that key and its corresponding value.
If a key appears in both m1 and m2, with the same corresponding value in both, then result must contain exactly one pair with that key and value.
When this function returns, result must contain no pairs other than those required by these rules. (You must not assume result is empty when it is passed in to this function; it might not be.)

If there exists a key that appears in both m1 and m2, but with different corresponding values, then this function returns false; if there is no key like this, the function returns true. Even if the function returns false, result must be constituted as defined by the above rules.

For example, suppose a Map maps strings to doubles. If m1 consists of the three pairs (in any order)

"Fred"  123      "Ethel"  456      "Lucy"  789
and m2 consists of (in any order)

"Lucy"  789      "Ricky"  321
then no matter what value it had before, result must end up as a map consisting of (in any order)

"Fred"  123      "Ricky"  321      "Lucy"  789     "Ethel"  456
and combine must return true. If instead, m1 were as before, and m2 consisted of

"Lucy"  654      "Ricky"  321
then no matter what value it had before, result must end up as a map consisting of (in any order)

"Fred"  123      "Ricky"  321      "Ethel"  456
and combine must return false.

void subtract(const Map& m1, const Map& m2, Map& result);
When this function returns, result must contain one copy of all the pairs in m1 whose keys don't appear in m2; it must not contain any other pairs. (You must not assume result is empty when it is passed in to this function; it may not be.)

For example, if m1 consists of the three pairs (in any order)

"Fred"  123      "Ethel"  456      "Lucy"  789
and m2 consists of (in any order)

"Lucy"  789      "Ricky"  321      "Ethel"  654
then no matter what value it had before, result must end up as a map consisting of

"Fred"  123
If English is not your native language, make extra sure you spell the name of this function correctly: it's subtract, not substract.

Be sure these functions behave correctly in the face of aliasing: What if m1 and result refer to the same Map, for example?

Other Requirements
Regardless of how much work you put into the assignment, your program will receive a zero for correctness if you violate these requirements:

Your class definition, declarations for the two required non-member functions, and the implementations of any functions you choose to inline must be in a file named Map.h, which must have appropriate include guards. The implementations of the functions you declared in Map.h that you did not inline must be in a file named Map.cpp. Neither of those files may have a main routine (unless it's commented out). You may use a separate file for the main routine to test your Map class; you won't turn in that separate file.

Except to add a destructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and dump function (described below), you must not add functions to, delete functions from, or change the public interface of the Map class. You must not declare any additional struct/class outside the Map class, and you must not declare any public struct/class inside the Map class. You may add whatever private data members and private member functions you like, and you may declare private structs/classes inside the Map class if you like. The source files you submit for this project must not contain the word friend or the character [ (open square bracket). You must not use any global variables whose values may be changed during execution. (Global constants are fine.)

If you wish, you may add a public member function with the signature void dump() const. The intent of this function is that for your own testing purposes, you can call it to print information about the map; we will never call it. You do not have to add this function if you don't want to, but if you do add it, it must not make any changes to the map; if we were to replace your implementation of this function with one that simply returned immediately, your code must still work correctly. The dump function must not write to cout, but it's allowed to write to cerr.

Map.cpp must not contain the word string or double. (Map.h may contain them only in using statements introducing type aliases, and must contain #include <string> if a using statement introducing a type alias contains the word string.)

Your code must build successfully (under both g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++) if linked with a file that contains a main routine.

You must have an implementation for every member function of Map, as well as the non-member functions combine and subtract. Even if you can't get a function implemented correctly, it must have an implementation that at least builds successfully. For example, if you don't have time to correctly implement Map::erase or subtract, say, here are implementations that meet this requirement in that they at least build successfully:

bool Map::erase(const KeyType& value)
{
return false;  // not correct, but at least this compiles
}

void subtract(const Map& m1, const Map& m2, Map& result)
{
// does nothing; not correct, but at least this compiles
}
You've probably met this requirement if the following file compiles and links with your code. (This uses magic beyond the scope of CS 32.)

#include "Map.h"
#include <type_traits>

#define CHECKTYPE(f, t) { auto p = static_cast<t>(f); (void)p; }

static_assert(std::is_default_constructible<Map>::value,
"Map must be default-constructible.");
static_assert(std::is_copy_constructible<Map>::value,
"Map must be copy-constructible.");

void ThisFunctionWillNeverBeCalled()
{
CHECKTYPE(&Map::operator=,      Map& (Map::*)(const Map&));
CHECKTYPE(&Map::empty,          bool (Map::*)() const);
CHECKTYPE(&Map::size,           int  (Map::*)() const);
CHECKTYPE(&Map::insert,         bool (Map::*)(const KeyType&, const ValueType&));
CHECKTYPE(&Map::update,         bool (Map::*)(const KeyType&, const ValueType&));
CHECKTYPE(&Map::insertOrUpdate, bool (Map::*)(const KeyType&, const ValueType&));
CHECKTYPE(&Map::erase,          bool (Map::*)(const KeyType&));
CHECKTYPE(&Map::contains,       bool (Map::*)(const KeyType&) const);
CHECKTYPE(&Map::get,            bool (Map::*)(const KeyType&, ValueType&) const);
CHECKTYPE(&Map::get,            bool (Map::*)(int, KeyType&, ValueType&) const);
CHECKTYPE(&Map::swap,           void (Map::*)(Map&));

CHECKTYPE(combine,  bool (*)(const Map&, const Map&, Map&));
CHECKTYPE(subtract, void (*)(const Map&, const Map&, Map&));
}

int main()
{}
If you add #include <string> to Map.h, have the type alias for Map's key type specify std::string, and have the type alias for its value type specify double, then if we make no change to your Map.cpp, compile it, and link it to a file containing

#include "Map.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

void test()
{
Map m;
assert(m.insert("Fred", 123));
assert(m.insert("Ethel", 456));
assert(m.size() == 2);
ValueType v = 42;
assert(!m.get("Lucy", v)  &&  v == 42);
assert(m.get("Fred", v)  &&  v == 123);
v = 42;
KeyType x = "Lucy";
assert(m.get(0, x, v)  &&
((x == "Fred"  &&  v == 123)  ||  (x == "Ethel"  &&  v == 456)));
KeyType x2 = "Ricky";
assert(m.get(1, x2, v)  &&
((x2 == "Fred"  &&  v == 123)  ||  (x2 == "Ethel"  &&  v == 456))  &&
x != x2);
}

int main()
{
test();
cout << "Passed all tests" << endl;
}
the linking must succeed. When the resulting executable is run, it must write Passed all tests and nothing more to cout, and terminate normally.

If we successfully do the above, then make no changes to Map.h other than to change the type aliases for Map so that KeyType specifies int and ValueType specifies std::string, make no changes to Map.cpp, recompile Map.cpp, and link it to a file containing

#include "Map.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

void test()
{
Map m;
assert(m.insert(10, "diez"));
assert(m.insert(20, "veinte"));
assert(m.size() == 2);
ValueType v = "cuarenta y dos";
assert(!m.get(30, v)  &&  v == "cuarenta y dos");
assert(m.get(10, v)  &&  v == "diez");
v = "cuarenta y dos";
KeyType x = 30;
assert(m.get(0, x, v)  &&
((x == 10  &&  v == "diez")  ||  (x == 20  &&  v == "veinte")));
KeyType x2 = 40;
assert(m.get(1, x2, v)  &&
((x2 == 10  &&  v == "diez")  ||  (x2 == 20  &&  v == "veinte"))  &&
x != x2);
}

int main()
{
test();
cout << "Passed all tests" << endl;
}
the linking must succeed. When the resulting executable is run, it must write Passed all tests and nothing more to cout, and terminate normally.

During execution, if a client performs actions whose behavior is defined by this spec, your program must not perform any undefined actions, such as dereferencing a null or uninitialized pointer.

Your code in Map.h and Map.cpp must not read anything from cin and must not write anything whatsoever to cout. If you want to print things out for debugging purposes, write to cerr instead of cout. cerr is the standard error destination; items written to it by default go to the screen. When we test your program, we will cause everything written to cerr to be discarded instead — we will never see that output, so you may leave those debugging output statements in your program if you wish.

Turn it in
By Monday, January 29, there will be a link on the class webpage that will enable you to turn in your source files and report. You will turn in a zip file containing these three files:

Map.h. When you turn in this file, the using statements must specify std::string as the KeyType and double as the ValueType.

Map.cpp. Function implementations should be appropriately commented to guide a reader of the code.

report.docx or report.doc (in Microsoft Word format) or report.txt (an ordinary text file) that contains:

a description of the design of your doubly-linked list implementation. (A couple of sentences will probably suffice, perhaps with a picture of a typical Map and an empty Map. Is the list circular? Does it have a dummy node? What's in your list nodes? Are they in any particular order?)

pseudocode for non-trivial algorithms (e.g., Map::erase and subtract).

a list of test cases that would thoroughly test the functions. Be sure to indicate the purpose of the tests. For example, here's the beginning of a presentation in the form of code:

The tests were performed on a map from strings to doubles

// default constructor
Map m;
// For an empty map:
assert(m.size() == 0);      // test size
assert(m.empty());          // test empty
assert(!m.erase("Ricky"));  // nothing to erase
Even if you do not correctly implement all the functions, you must still list test cases that would test them. Don't lose points by thinking "Well, I didn't implement this function, so I won't bother saying how I would have tested it if I had implemented it."
